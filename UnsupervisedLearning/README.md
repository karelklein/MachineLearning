# Unsupervised Learning
Experiments using unsupervised learning algorithms on diabetes and census income data. Utilized clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms including:
	- k-Means
	- Expectation Maximization
	- PCA
	- ICA
	- SVD

## Analysis

## Datasets
Diabetes and Census Income data sets were sourced directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
They can be found in the datasets/ directory, where the prefixes d_ and c_ refer to the diabetes and census set, respectively.

## Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- SciKit-Learn
- SciPy
