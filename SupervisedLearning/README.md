# Supervised Learning
Experiments using supervised learning algorithms on diabetes and census income data. Algorithms include:
	- Decision Trees
	- Support Vector Machines
	- Boosting
	- k-Nearest Neighbors
	- Neural Networks

## Analysis
- kkc3-analysis.pdf

## Software
- All experiments and algorithms were performed using WEKA version 3.8.1
- Model complexity experiments were conducted with the WEKA Experimenter.
- Model training and testing were conducted with the WEKA Explorer.

## Data
- The census income data set is a subset of the data provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository found at:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
	- census_ALL.arff - The full Income dataset used in this project
	- census_TRAIN.arff - 80 percent of census_ALL used for training learners
	- census_TEST.arff - 20 percent of census_ALL used for testing learners

The Pimas Indians Diabetes Data Set is the set of data provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes
	- diabetes_ALL.arff - The full Diabetes dataset used in this project
	- diabetes_TRAIN.arff - 80 percent of diabetes_ALL used for training learners
	- diabetes_TEST.arff - 20 percent of diabetes_ALL used for testing learners
